# To do list Java

## About
### This project is another to do list web site, its not very original but it was the easiest thing for this specific project.
### Now what is this project? I decided to code everything in note pad, why? because I hate myself thats why.
### Sadly this project wont be finished anytime soon, as I am still learning how to manually do everything.
### Hope you enjoy looking at my suffering.
